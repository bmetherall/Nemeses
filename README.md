# Nemeses

To find the nemeses of someone copy `WCA_export_RanksSingle.tsv` and `WCA_export_RanksAverage.tsv` to this directory. Then run `Find_Nemeses.py` followed by the desired WCA ID. For example
`$ python Find_Nemeses.py 2009METH01`. This will create a tab separated file with all nemeses (including ties) and their results.
